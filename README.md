Owen's API

An API for tracking exactly what Owen is doing... constantly...
It's not creepy I promise.

#### Access
Server is accessible at: owen-action-api.vercel.app

### Commands

- **/help (GET)** - get a list of commands
- **/set/{password}/{action} (GET)** - For Owen to set his current action, you don't get the password!
- **/history (GET)** - Get a history of all action, complete with timestamps {"history": [Actions]}
- **/get (POST)** - Get an action based on time or name: {"action": String, "time": Int (Unix Time)}
- **/current** (GET) - Get Owen's current action {"current": "{action}"}

### Notes

For RaspAPI Reviewers, you won't be able to access /set because you do not have the password. This is what it does return when you DO have the password.
